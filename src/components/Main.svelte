				'The Ranked Choice Voting Calculator is a single page web application designed to facilitate the tally of a ranked choice vote involving 3-5 candidates and up to 20 voters. I originally came up with this idea to solve a problem. My friends and I have a music listening group where we use ranked-choice voting to decide what album we will listen to together. I chose Svelte as the framework because of its small bundle size and fast load times. I used Vite as the bundler because of its speed and ease of use. I also used Tailwind for styling because of its utility-first approach.',

I leveraged React context for simplified state management and component architecture. On the backend, I enhanced performance through SQL and JavaScript query optimizations, reducing HTTP durations by 25%. I implemented load balancing across multiple AWS EC2 instances with NGINX to achieve 12ms response time per query at 1000rps throughput with 0% errors. This project exemplifies not only my frontend UX skills, but also my performance-focused approach to the backend, applying data caching, query optimizations, cloud scaling and load testing to significantly improve customer experience.",
