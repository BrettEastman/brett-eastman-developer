			"For fun and as a way to explore cutting-edge technology, I built and deployed bretteastmanstudio.comâ€”a site hosting my music teaching materials alongside an AI-powered music historian chatbot for students seeking deeper knowledge about artists and topics. I integrated Google's lightweight gemini-2.0-flash model with contextual memory of the past 5 chats to deliver functionality at minimal cost. The backend runs on a cost-effective Linode Nanode instance hosting an open-source Pocketbase database, secured behind an NGINX reverse proxy with HTTPS via Let's Encrypt and rate limiting for protection. The project leverages SvelteKit with Svelte 5 syntax, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Cloudflare, demonstrating my ability to architect full-stack applications that combine modern web technologies with AI integration and robust deployment practices.",

I was responsible for implementing a feature to the project, using Nodemailer, to automatically send confirmation emails to new para-professionals as they are added to the database by the teacher. I also engineered the design team's designs for the Student page and Staff page, implementing the backend procedures to allow teachers to add/edit/remove students and paras.",

			'The Ranked Choice Voting Calculator is a single page web application designed to facilitate the tally of a ranked choice vote involving 3-5 candidates and up to 20 voters. I originally came up with this idea to solve a problem. My friends and I have a music listening group where we use ranked-choice voting to decide what album we will listen to together. I chose Svelte as the framework because of its small bundle size and fast load times. I used Vite as the bundler because of its speed and ease of use. I also used Tailwind for styling because of its utility-first approach.',

			"Dinomite Designs is a Full Stack project where my team redesigned and optimized a retail website's product portal including details, Q&A, reviews and recommendations. I leveraged React context for simplified state management and component architecture. On the backend, I enhanced performance through SQL and JavaScript query optimizations, reducing HTTP durations by 25%. I implemented load balancing across multiple AWS EC2 instances with NGINX to achieve 12ms response time per query at 1000rps throughput with 0% errors. This project exemplifies not only my frontend UX skills, but also my performance-focused approach to the backend, applying data caching, query optimizations, cloud scaling and load testing to significantly improve customer experience.",
