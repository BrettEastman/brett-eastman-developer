			"At LydianLab, a boutique web development agency, we specialize in creating user-friendly applications with modern technologies for clients in music education. We are currently designing and developing a web application for a jazz camp's online music theory evaluation exam. By leveraging MUIâ€™s layout-first approach to CSS, we increased development speed by 50%. We chose the VexFlow open-source music notation library for its small bundle size and fast load times, ensuring an engaging user experience. Additionally, we architected a robust core user authentication flow using Firebase's provider layer and hooks for seamless state management.",

			'As an independent contractor, I have been lending my skills to local entities such as Helia Music Collective, who asked me to build a new site for them with a revised design. I used Astro as a meta-framework for this project for flexibility, SEO friendliness, and speed. Astro combines a server-first architecture with a focus on content, which can result in websites that load 40% faster and use 90% less JavaScript than other frameworks. I gave the site a modern design with light and dark mode options included, and I deployed it on Cloudflare pages. The Lighthouse score is 100% for SEO, Accessibility, and Best Practices.',
