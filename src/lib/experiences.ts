			"At LydianLab, a boutique web development agency, we specialize in creating user-friendly applications with modern technologies for clients in music education. We are currently designing and developing a web application for a jazz camp's online music theory evaluation exam. By leveraging MUIâ€™s layout-first approach to CSS, we increased development speed by 50%. We chose the VexFlow open-source music notation library for its small bundle size and fast load times, ensuring an engaging user experience. Additionally, we architected the authentication flow, database, cloud storage, and deployment using Firebase for industrial grade performance.",

			'As an independent contractor, I have been lending my skills to local entities such as Helia Music Collective, who asked me to build a new site for them with a revised design. I used Astro as a meta-framework for this project for flexibility, SEO friendliness, and speed. Astro combines a server-first architecture with a focus on content, which can result in websites that load 40% faster and use 90% less JavaScript than other frameworks. I gave the site a modern design with light and dark mode options included, and I deployed it on Cloudflare pages. The Lighthouse score is 100% for SEO, Accessibility, and Best Practices.',
