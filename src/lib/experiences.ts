			"At LydianLab, we specialize in building user-friendly applications with modern technologies for clients in music education. Currently, we’re developing a web application for a jazz camp's online music theory evaluation exam. Using MUI’s layout-first approach to CSS and scoped CSS, we implemented our designs twice as fast. I also designed the authentication flow, database, cloud storage, and deployment infrastructure with Firebase to deliver reliable performance. For music notation, we chose the VexFlow open-source library for its compact bundle size and fast load times, ensuring an engaging user experience.",

			'As an independent contractor, I have been lending my skills to local entities such as Helia Music Collective, who asked me to build a new site for them with a revised design. I used Astro as a meta-framework for this project for flexibility, SEO friendliness, and speed. I gave the site a modern design with light and dark mode options included, and I deployed it on Cloudflare pages. The Lighthouse score is 100% for SEO, Accessibility, and Best Practices.',
