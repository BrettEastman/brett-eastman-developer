			"At Lydian Labs, a boutique web development agency, we specialize in creating user-friendly applications with modern technologies for clients in music education. We are currently designing and developing a web application for a jazz camp's online music theory evaluation exam. By leveraging MUIâ€™s layout-first approach to CSS, we increased development speed by 50%. We chose the VexFlow open-source music notation library for its small bundle size and fast load times, ensuring an engaging user experience. Additionally, we architected a robust core user authentication flow using Firebase's provider layer and hooks for seamless state management.",
